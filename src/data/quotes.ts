One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.",

They dislike being alone because it is verily and indeed an awful idea to be alone. Barbarians fear the unknown for the same reason that Agnostics worship it-because it is a fact. Fairy tales, then, are not responsible for producing in children fear, or any of the shapes of fear; fairy tales do not give the child the idea of the evil or the ugly; that is in the child already, because it is in the world already. Fairy tales do not give the child his first idea of bogey. What fairy tales give the child is his first clear idea of the possible defeat of bogey. The baby has known the dragon intimately ever since he had an imagination. What the fairy tale provides for him is a St. George to kill the dragon.",

When he has no respect for anyone, he can no longer love, and, in order to divert himself, having no love in him, he yields to his impulses, indulges in the lowest forms of pleasure, and behaves in the end like an animal. And it all comes from lying - lying to others and to yourself.",

I discovered that I am not disciplined out of virtue but as a reaction to my negligence, that I appear generous in order to conceal my meanness, that I pass myself off as prudent because I am evil-minded, that I am conciliatory in order not to succumb to my repressed rage, that I am punctual only to hide how little I care about other people's time.

    content: "What seems obvious to you that the rest of humanity hasn't figured out yet? The most obvious one: reality isn't just 'out there'; it's shaped by what we choose to perceive and act on. humanity endlessly debates objective vs. subjective truth, but the truth is: both co-create each other. people waste lifetimes seeking 'meaning' or 'truth' without realising they're the ones writing it. Second: the future doesn't belong to the smartest or the strongest but to those who adapt quickest to chaos. most people are over-optimising stability in a world that rewards anti-fragility. Third: the collective delusion that governments, corporations, or anyone else will save us. nobody is coming to rescue you. your life is yours to shape, and most systems are indifferent at best or parasitic at worst. Also, the obvious sleeper-time isn't linear, it's exponential. people fail to grasp the compounding effects of their choices (or inactions) over time. this applies to everything: health, knowledge, wealth, relationships. small, consistent inputs beat grand gestures every time. And the real kicker: the universe doesn't care about you, but that's liberating, not nihilistic. it means you're free to matter as much as you decide.",

You are here. And every choice you have ever made has led you to right now, reading this. While you exist, every movement and moment matters; those bad choices led you to the best days of your life, if you were to play it all in rewind. Change will come, even if you're standing still. Butterflies will keep flapping their wings and causing hurricanes. So, make your choices and make them loud. Trust your gut. Trust energy. And if you ceased to exist? Oh, the universe would notice. The mess that would make. The hearts that would break. So just stay. Stay for bad choices. Stay for great ones. Stay. Cause a few hurricanes.",

    content: "We said goodbye to our mothers. They'd been around all our lives, but we'd never properly seen them. They'd been bent over washing tubs or cooking pots, their faces red and swollen from heat and steam, holding everything together while our fathers were away at sea, and nodding off every night on the kitchen chair, with a darning needle in hand. It was their endurance and exhaustion we knew, rather than them. And we never asked them for anything because we didn't want to bother them. That was how we showed our love: with silence. Their eyes were always red. In the morning, when they woke us up, it was from stove smoke. And in the evening, when they said good night to us, still dressed, it was from exhaustion. And sometimes it was from crying over someone who would never come home again. Ask us about the colour of a mother's eyes, and we'd reply, 'They're not brown. They aren't green. They're neither blue nor gray. They're red.' That's what we'd say. And now they've come down alongside the wharf to say goodbye. But between us, there's silence. Their eyes pierce us. 'Come back,' their stare pleads. 'Don't leave us.' But we won't be coming back. We want out. We want to get away. Our mother sticks a knife in our heart when we say goodbye on the wharf. And we stick a knife in hers when we go. And that's how we're connected: through the hurt we inflict on one another.",

    content: "What seems obvious to you that the rest of humanity hasn't figured out yet? The most obvious one: reality isn't just 'out there'; it's shaped by what we choose to perceive and act on. humanity endlessly debates objective vs. subjective truth, but the truth is: both co-create each other. people waste lifetimes seeking 'meaning' or 'truth' without realising they're the ones writing it. Second: the future doesn't belong to the smartest or the strongest but to those who adapt quickest to chaos. most people are over-optimising stability in a world that rewards anti-fragility. Third: the collective delusion that governments, corporations, or anyone else will save us. nobody is coming to rescue you. your life is yours to shape, and most systems are indifferent at best or parasitic at worst. Also, the obvious sleeper-time isn't linear, it's exponential. people fail to grasp the compounding effects of their choices (or inactions) over time. this applies to everything: health, knowledge, wealth, relationships. small, consistent inputs beat grand gestures every time. And the real kicker: the universe doesn't care about you, but that's liberating, not nihilistic. it means you're free to matter as much as you decide.",

They are colored by your emotions and how you were feeling and colored by your memory itself. Your mind exaggerates some things and totally forgets other things. Someone else who experienced the exact same thing as you most likely remembers it much differently. Memories are NOT accurate and CANNOT be trusted. We gain our sense of self from our memories. We decide who we are because of our memories. We write a story about our life and tell ourselves that story to form our sense of self. Because the past doesn't exist anymore and what you remember happening probably didn't happen the way you remember at all, you can rewrite it. Rewrite the story you tell about yourself to yourself. Rewrite your personal story and rewrite your past and you rewrite yourself.",
