  "Effortlessness is the ultimate show of mastery. Coolness captivates us because it hides the labor behind the spectacular, presenting us with the facade of an I-was-born-this-way genius. Coolness is sexy because it carries the mythos that divine talent cannot be taught, only bestowed. It's messianic. It's a glimpse of transcendence, a break from the mundane and the toil of practice.

  "I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn't quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn't make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet. - Sylvia Plath",

  "The timidity of the child or the savage is entirely reasonable; they are alarmed at this world, because this world is a very alarming place. They dislike being alone because it is verily and indeed an awful idea to be alone. Barbarians fear the unknown for the same reason that Agnostics worship it-because it is a fact. Fairy tales, then, are not responsible for producing in children fear, or any of the shapes of fear; fairy tales do not give the child the idea of the evil or the ugly; that is in the child already, because it is in the world already. Fairy tales do not give the child his first idea of bogey. What fairy tales give the child is his first clear idea of the possible defeat of bogey. The baby has known the dragon intimately ever since he had an imagination. What the fairy tale provides for him is a St. George to kill the dragon. - Unknown",
  "A man who lies to himself, and believes his own lies becomes unable to recognise truth, either in himself or in anyone else, and he ends up losing respect for himself and for others. When he has no respect for anyone, he can no longer love, and, in order to divert himself, having no love in him, he yields to his impulses, indulges in the lowest forms of pleasure, and behaves in the end like an animal. And it all comes from lying - lying to others and to yourself. - Dostoyevsky",

  "Steadiness, calmness, a stable sense of self-confidence. The kind that allows them to express vulnerability without feeling destabilised, and to not be scared of the strength of their own emotions. Relatedly, good discernment. A moral compass oriented towards kindness. - Unknown",
  "I think I might need to come to terms with the possibility that I never find one. And I think of all the love I have to give I could give to that one person and If I don't find them I'll just spread it away to everybody else. And the world. - Unknown",
  "Burry me shallow, I'll be back. - Unknown",
  "A water bottle at the store costs $1. The same bottle at a hotel is $3 and at an airport, $5. Same bottle, same brand. The only thing that changes is the place. Each place gives a different value to the same item. When you feel worthless, change places. - Unknown",

  "After copulation the Devi's laughter can be heard. - Unknown",
  "Why do we feel it's necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable? A very interesting and truthful question. Because there is anxiety and tension in the air, particularly if there is infatuation. This builds tension. Tension is released through human interaction : kissing, touching, laughing and of course talking about 'bullshit' in order to be comfortable. I study human interaction, particularly relationships. - Unknown",

  "It's not enough that I win, others must fail. - Unknown",
  "Don't speak negatively about yourself, even as a joke. Your body doesn't know the difference. Words are energy and cast spells, that's why it's called spelling. Change the way you speak about yourself and you can change your life. What you're not changing, you're also choosing. - Bruce Lee",

  "They have ears, but they will not hear. They have eyes, but they will not see. - Unknown",
  "I discovered that my obsession for having each thing in the right place, each subject at the right time, each word in the right style, was not the well-deserved reward of an ordered mind but just the opposite: a complete system of pretence invented by me to hide the disorder of my nature. I discovered that I am not disciplined out of virtue but as a reaction to my negligence, that I appear generous in order to conceal my meanness, that I pass myself off as prudent because I am evil-minded, that I am conciliatory in order not to succumb to my repressed rage, that I am punctual only to hide how little I care about other people's time. I learned, in short, that love is not a condition of the spirit but a sign of the zodiac. - Gabriel Garcia Marquez",
  "Just as real events are forgotten, some that never were can be in our memories as if they happened. - Unknown",
  "Privatise gains, socialise losses. - Unknown",
  "The work we do is a reflection of who we are. Sloppy work is a reflection of scattered thoughts and lazy work is a reflection of your indolent tendencies. You are not bored with your job, you are bored with who you are. A messy room is a reflection of your chaotic mind and being late is a reflection of your lack of self-respect. - Michael E. Gerber",

  "A man who has not passed through the inferno of his passions has never overcome them. They then dwell in the house next door, and at any moment a flame may dart out and set fire to his own house. Whenever we give up, leave behind, and forget too much, there is always the danger that the things we have neglected will return with added force. - Carl Jung",
  "He who cannot obey himself will be commanded. - Unknown",

  "If printing money would end poverty, printing diplomas would end stupidity. - Milei",
  "You obsess over your identity in relation to others while your soul rots inside of you - xoxoabbyxoxox",
  "Quitting porn is the rite of passage for the modern young man. Ironically it's probably one of the hardest rites of passage of any society ever. Theirs were mostly physical or mental; hunting solo for the first time, fighting a battle, making an artisan piece, passing hard exams. Now our rite of passage is spiritual, defeating the beast within our very selves. To endure and turn away from the most temptation ever offered; endless amounts of freely available HD hardcore pornography. From learning to defeat this deepest darkness, we will climb higher than any of our forefathers. - Unknown",
  "What seems obvious to you that the rest of humanity hasn't figured out yet? The most obvious one: reality isn't just 'out there'; it's shaped by what we choose to perceive and act on. humanity endlessly debates objective vs. subjective truth, but the truth is: both co-create each other. people waste lifetimes seeking 'meaning' or 'truth' without realising they're the ones writing it. Second: the future doesn't belong to the smartest or the strongest but to those who adapt quickest to chaos. most people are over-optimising stability in a world that rewards anti-fragility. Third: the collective delusion that governments, corporations, or anyone else will save us. nobody is coming to rescue you. your life is yours to shape, and most systems are indifferent at best or parasitic at worst. Also, the obvious sleeper-time isn't linear, it's exponential. people fail to grasp the compounding effects of their choices (or inactions) over time. this applies to everything: health, knowledge, wealth, relationships. small, consistent inputs beat grand gestures every time. And the real kicker: the universe doesn't care about you, but that's liberating, not nihilistic. it means you're free to matter as much as you decide. - Unknown",
  "After 37 years of age, l've finally come to realize the cure to depression to a man is just leaving the house at every single possible opportunity no matter how badly you don't want to. - Unknown",
  "I wonder how many people I've look at all my life and never seen. - Steinbeck",
  "Just Do it. - Unknown",

  "Do you wanna be right? Or do you wanna make money? - Unknown",
  "Courage cannot be counter feited, It is one virtue that escapes hypocrisy - Napoleon Bonaparte",
  "Chaos is a ladder. - Littlefinger",
  "You need to stay. And you need to stay loudly. You're afraid of making bad choices but the truth is this: the tiniest actions will influence the course of the rest of your life and you cannot control it. So many factors play a part in you being here today: a delayed train, an extra cup of tea, the number of seconds your parents took to cross the street. This is chaos theory. Sensitivity. Mathematics. You are here. And every choice you have ever made has led you to right now, reading this. While you exist, every movement and moment matters; those bad choices led you to the best days of your life, if you were to play it all in rewind. Change will come, even if you're standing still. Butterflies will keep flapping their wings and causing hurricanes. So, make your choices and make them loud. Trust your gut. Trust energy. And if you ceased to exist? Oh, the universe would notice. The mess that would make. The hearts that would break. So just stay. Stay for bad choices. Stay for great ones. Stay. Cause a few hurricanes. - srepoetry",
  "We said goodbye to our mothers. They'd been around all our lives, but we'd never properly seen them. They'd been bent over washing tubs or cooking pots, their faces red and swollen from heat and steam, holding everything together while our fathers were away at sea, and nodding off every night on the kitchen chair, with a darning needle in hand. It was their endurance and exhaustion we knew, rather than them. And we never asked them for anything because we didn't want to bother them. That was how we showed our love: with silence. Their eyes were always red. In the morning, when they woke us up, it was from stove smoke. And in the evening, when they said good night to us, still dressed, it was from exhaustion. And sometimes it was from crying over someone who would never come home again. Ask us about the colour of a mother's eyes, and we'd reply, 'They're not brown. They aren't green. They're neither blue nor gray. They're red.' That's what we'd say. And now they've come down alongside the wharf to say goodbye. But between us, there's silence. Their eyes pierce us. 'Come back,' their stare pleads. 'Don't leave us.' But we won't be coming back. We want out. We want to get away. Our mother sticks a knife in our heart when we say goodbye on the wharf. And we stick a knife in hers when we go. And that's how we're connected: through the hurt we inflict on one another. - Carsten Jensen",
  "A woman can grow to love a man, but a man either loves you from the start or doesn't. I will not elaborate on this. - Unknown",
  "Obsession beats talent. - Unknown",
  "The world is a malleable place. If you know what you want, and you go for it with maximum energy and passion, the world will often reconfigure itself around you much more quickly and easily than you would think. - Marc Andreessen",
  "The only real Measure of intelligence is if you can get what you want from Life. - Unknown",
  "When a man is tired, he's attacked by ideas he conquered long ago - Nietzsche",
  "Law 32: Play to People's Fantasies. The truth is often avoided because it is ugly and unpleasant. Never appeal to truth and reality unless you are prepared for the anger that comes for disenchantment. Life is so harsh and distressing that people who can manufacture romance or conjure up fantasy are like oases in the desert: Everyone flocks to them. There is great power in tapping into the fantasies of the masses. - Unknown",
  "When you're financially stable in a walkable city 3 drinks deep with the love of your life...that is the moment life gets better. - Unknown",
  "Most successful people I've met are not that smart. They just move fast, take risks and work a lot. Trust me. - Unknown",
  "Shame only lives in the shadows. - Unknown",
  "The best posts hit like a gut punch or a warm hug—something visceral. people don't remember smart takes, they remember the ones that made them feel something real. pain, love, joy, loss—those are universal. the best writing drags people into your world & makes them live it for a moment. - Unknown",
  "You already know the story. You will die. Everyone you love will also die. You will lose them forever. You will be sad and angry. You will weep. You will bar-gain. You will make demands. You will beg. You will pray. It will make no differ-ence. Nothing you can do will bring them back. You know this. Your knowing changes nothing. This poem will make you understand this unfathomable truth again and again, as if for the very first time. - Unknown",
  "Good pussy has healing powers. - Unknown",

  "What you have to remember about the past is that it literally DOESN'T exist. It exists ONLY in your mind, your memories. No more real than a daydream is. What you also have to remember is that your memories are most likely not as accurate as you think they are. They are colored by your emotions and how you were feeling and colored by your memory itself. Your mind exaggerates some things and totally forgets other things. Someone else who experienced the exact same thing as you most likely remembers it much differently. Memories are NOT accurate and CANNOT be trusted. We gain our sense of self from our memories. We decide who we are because of our memories. We write a story about our life and tell ourselves that story to form our sense of self. Because the past doesn't exist anymore and what you remember happening probably didn't happen the way you remember at all, you can rewrite it. Rewrite the story you tell about yourself to yourself. Rewrite your personal story and rewrite your past and you rewrite yourself. - Unknown",
