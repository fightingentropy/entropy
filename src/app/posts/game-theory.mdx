# Game Theory: Your Strategic Playbook for Everyday Life

> "The hardest part of any game is figuring out what the other player thinks **you** will do next."

## Why bother with game theory?

You already use it—every time you split a bill, haggle over rent, decide whether to text first, or hold serve at match‑point. The formal apparatus of game theory turns those gut hunches into a clear framework so that you can:

* **List every plausible move** (including ones you might miss in the moment)
* **Anticipate reactions** instead of guessing
* **Pick rationally**—maximising upside while limiting downside

Think of it as a mental Swiss‑Army knife for social life, finance, politics, and even Friday‑night plans.

## A thirty‑second timeline

* **1944** — John von Neumann & Oskar Morgenstern publish *Theory of Games and Economic Behavior*, birthing the field
* **1950** — John Nash proves his equilibrium theorem (yes, the *A Beautiful Mind* guy)
* **1960‑1980s** — Economists adapt the tools to bargaining, auctions, and international trade
* **1990‑2020** — Evolutionary biologists, AI engineers, and political scientists push game theory mainstream

## The three building blocks

### 1. Players

Anyone whose choice affects the outcome—yourself, your mates, rival firms, entire countries.

### 2. Strategies

Every action a player can take. For a dinner debate that might mean "order sushi," "order pizza," or "skip dinner."

### 3. Payoffs

The result each player receives once all choices are revealed—measured in **utility**, not just cash.

> **Example – Choosing where to eat**
>
> * If you both choose **pizza**, you score 3 happiness points while your friend scores 4
> * If you pick **pizza** and they pick **sushi**, you get 1 and they get 2
> * If you pick **sushi** and they pick **pizza**, you earn 2 and they earn 1
> * If you both pick **sushi**, you each do pretty well: you score 4, your friend 3
>
> Those numbers don't need to be exact—only to rank outcomes in the right order.

## Utility: the personal scorecard

Utility ranks outcomes by preference. A £50 win may thrill a student (utility = 10) but bore a hedge‑fund manager (utility = 2). Game theory only cares about those relative rankings, not the absolute pounds.

---

## Types of games you meet in the wild

* **Zero‑sum:** the pie is fixed; your gain is my loss (tennis, most poker hands)
* **Non‑zero‑sum:** cooperation can enlarge or shrink the pie (business partnerships, climate deals)
* **Cooperative:** players can strike binding agreements (forming a cartel, planning a group holiday)
* **Non‑cooperative:** everyone acts alone (auction bidding, casual dating)
* **Repeated:** the same interaction happens again and again—past behaviour shapes trust (weekly five‑a‑side football)
* **Sequential:** moves unfold one after another (property bidding wars)

---

## How to spot an equilibrium

* **Dominant strategy:** a move that beats all your other moves, no matter what others do
* **Nash equilibrium:** no player can unilaterally improve their payoff by switching strategies
* **Minimax:** in zero‑sum games, choose the play that *maximises your worst‑case* payoff

At equilibrium everyone feels, "If I changed now, I'd be worse off—given what the rest are doing."

---

## Mixed strategies: calculated unpredictability

When no pure strategy dominates, sprinkle in randomness. For example, serve wide 40% of the time and down‑the‑T 60% so your tennis opponent can't camp on one side. The mix is chosen to make rivals indifferent and therefore unable to exploit you.

---

## Real‑life snapshots

* **Late‑night Uber standoff:** both rider and driver hope the *other* cancels to avoid a £5 fee. Classic "Chicken"
* **Dating apps:** you decide whether to send the first message without knowing the other person's interest level. A Bayesian game of hidden information
* **Trading the market:** you want profit even if prices crash; minimax thinking limits worst‑case loss
* **Group holiday to Ibiza:** friends must agree on a destination and split costs fairly—cooperative game territory, where concepts like the Shapley value help divide gains

---

## Levelling up: advanced lenses (one‑liners)

* **Incomplete information** → Bet on *beliefs* about hidden traits (sealed‑bid auctions)
* **Evolutionary dynamics** → Why "tit‑for‑tat" thrives in repeated dilemmas (cultural norms)
* **Mechanism design** → Flip the script: craft rules so strategic players reveal truth (carbon credits, e‑Bay)

---

## Key take‑aways checklist

* Identify **players, strategies, payoffs** before debating options
* Translate outcomes into **utility**, not just money
* Ask: "Can anyone switch and do better?" If not, you've found equilibrium
* Introduce randomness when predictability becomes a liability
* Remember: most real‑world conflicts are **non‑zero‑sum**—look for ways to expand the pie

## Final word

Game theory won't predict every twist of human emotion, but it **sharpens your odds**—at the poker table, in the boardroom, on a first date, or queuing for a 3 a.m. kebab on Old Street. Treat it as a discipline of *structured curiosity*: always ask, *"If our roles were reversed, what would **I** do?"* Master that habit and you'll rarely play life on the back foot.
