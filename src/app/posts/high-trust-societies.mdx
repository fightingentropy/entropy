**Key Takeaways**

- High trust lowers transaction costs and boosts economic growth.
- It underpins stable, transparent governance and democratic legitimacy.
- Societies with high social trust enjoy stronger social cohesion and well-being.
- Trust acts as an informal public good, facilitating collective action.
- Erosion of trust leads to higher corruption, fragile institutions, and polarization.


## Condensed Overview

High-trust societies are places where most people expect honesty and cooperation from one another and from their institutions. Such trust lowers transaction costs, powers innovation, and underwrites social cohesion. Conversely, when trust erodes, corruption rises, politics polarizes, and economic growth stalls.

### Why Trust Matters

1. **Economic engine —** handshake deals, cheaper contracts, and vibrant entrepreneurship.
2. **Governance glue —** voluntary compliance and legitimacy reduce the need for coercion.
3. **Social capital —** dense civic networks, mutual aid, and higher well-being.

### What High-Trust Looks Like

| Domain | High-Trust Society | Low-Trust Society |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Interpersonal | "Most people can be trusted" (>50 %) | Fear of exploitation (<10 %) |
| Institutions | Transparent, low corruption | Nepotism, weak rule of law |
| Economy | Large-scale firms, low friction | Family firms, high transaction costs |
| Civic Life | Active volunteering, strong NGOs | Sparse civil society |
| Outcomes | Growth, happiness, stability | Stagnation, conflict |

### How High Trust Emerges

• **Culture & values** – norms of honesty and reciprocity widen the “radius of trust.”
• **Inclusive institutions** – fair courts, free media, and safety nets reward trustworthy behaviour.
• **Positive feedback loops** – good experiences with strangers reinforce the instinct to trust again.

### Snapshot Case Studies

– **Nordic Model**: Universal welfare and egalitarian culture created a self-reinforcing trust spiral; today the region tops global trust and governance rankings.

– **Post-war Western Europe**: Democratic rebuilding plus broad prosperity turned war-torn societies into cooperative, high-trust polities by the late 20th century.

– **Mid-century America**: Dense civic organisations and shared prosperity once produced high trust; rising inequality, polarization, and institutional scandals later eroded it.

### Threats to Trust Today

* Economic inequality and stalled mobility
* Political polarization & media fragmentation
* Corruption or opaque decision-making
* Rapid cultural change without integration
* Digital mis/disinformation

### Preserving & Rebuilding Trust

1. **Make institutions transparent & fair.** Anti-corruption enforcement, open data, and equal treatment are non-negotiable.
2. **Foster inclusive growth.** Policies that spread opportunity reduce zero-sum perceptions.
3. **Invest in civic infrastructure.** Schools, libraries, and voluntary associations knit diverse citizens together.
4. **Curb disinformation.** Promote trustworthy journalism and media literacy.
5. **Lead by example.** Trustworthy behaviour from elites cascades through society.

## Conclusion

Trust is an invisible form of capital. When abundant it powers flourishing democracies and economies; when scarce it exacts steep social costs. Building and safeguarding this capital is therefore one of the most important—and most overlooked—tasks of modern governance and civic life.
